"the snakes going to the eagles' land with someone named Paul, aka the caretaker of the network of the birds"

so are the snake and eagle in the MX flag fighting? or it is prophecied that the snakes will be 
carried by a gigantic metallic bird to the bird land and in the birdland, the birds will carry the snakes to see what's up in the land From a Vantage point?

so fuck these shitters hindu hindu fucks, they are trying to make the snakes (what they call naga) and the birds (what they call garuda) fight.

and what is happening in ukraine and russia today? 

same pattern.

birds and snakes being pitted against each others by the shitters.
